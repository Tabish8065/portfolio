## 🤖 Built With AI, Directed By Me

The code for this portfolio was generated by leveraging AI (Claude by Anthropic) — but the imagination, creative direction, content curation, and supervision behind every design choice, animation, and detail is entirely mine. AI was the tool; the vision was human.
